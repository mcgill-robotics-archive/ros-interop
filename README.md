This ROS package provides a client to communicate with the
[AUVSI SUAS Interopability server](https://github.com/auvsi-suas/interop).

*This package has been tested on ROS Kinetic Kame on Ubuntu 16.04.*

## Setting up

You must clone this repository as `interop` into your catkin workspace:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mcgill-robotics/ros-interop.git interop
```

## Dependencies

Before proceeding, make sure to install all dependencies by running:

```bash
rosdep update
rosdep install interop
```

## Compiling

You **must** compile this package before being able to run it. You can do so
by running:

```bash
catkin_make
```

from the root of your `catkin` workspace.

### Testing

You can run the ROS tests to make sure the package is indeed functional by
running the following from the root of your `catkin` workspace:

```bash
catkin_make run_tests
```

## Running

To run, simply launch the package with:

```bash
roslaunch interop interop.launch base_url:=<base_url> username:=<username> password:=<password>
```

or, if you prefer:

```bash
export INTEROP_HOST=<base_url>
export INTEROP_USERNAME=<username>
export INTEROP PASSWORD=<password>
roslaunch interop interop.launch
```

## Nodes

This package has the following nodes available:

### `obstacles`

This by default publishes both moving and stationary obstacles at 20 Hz to the
following topics:

-   `~moving`: Moving obstacles, `visualization_msgs/MarkerArray`.
-   `~stationary`: Stationary obstacles, `visualization_msgs/MarkerArray`.

#### Visualizing

Stationary and moving obstacles can be visualized in `rviz` as `MarkerArray`s
relative to the `odom` frame in UTM coordinates. Note that the marker's
positions are in UTM coordinates, so you will likely not be able to see the
obstacles in `rviz` (they will be *very* far away) without a static
transformation to cancel this out. For example, you could have a static
transformation `map -> odom` of your drone's starting position or your ground
station's position in UTM coordinates, and then visualize the obstacles
relative to the `map` frame.

If set up properly, it should look like this:

where the cylinder is a stationary obstacle, and the sphere is a moving
obstacle.


### `mission_info`

This by default publishes mission information at 1 Hz to the following topics:

-   `~flyzones`: Flight boundaries, `FlyZoneArray`.
-   `~search_grid`: Search grid area, `geometry_msgs/PolygonStamped`.
-   `~waypoints`: List of waypoints, `visualization_msgs/Marker`.
-   `~air_drop_pos`: Air drop position, `geometry_msgs/PointStamped`.
-   `~off_axis_targ`: Off axis target position, `geometry_msgs/PointStamped`.
-   `~emergent_targ_loc`: Emergent target last known location,
                          `geometry_msgs/PointStamped`.
-   `~utm_zone`: UTM zone number and UTM zone letter, `UTMZone`.

This also provides the following services to change missions:

-   `~get_active_mission`: Change the mission being published to the current
                           active mission, `std_srvs/Trigger`
-   `~get_mission_by_id` : Change the mission being published to the mission of
                           the given id, `GetMissionByID`

### `telemetry`

This by default subscribes to telemetry data on the following topics, and
uploads them to the interoperability server:

-   `/mavros/global_position/global`: GPS and altitude data,
    `sensor_msgs/NavSatFix`.
-   `/mavros/global_position/compass_hdg`: Current heading in degrees relative
    to true north, `std_msgs/Float64`.

### `targets`

This by default serves ROS services to interact with the interoperability
targets API with the following:

#### Targets

-   `~add`: Adds new target, `AddTarget`.
-   `~get`: Retrieves specific target, `GetTarget`.
-   `~update`: Updates specific target with new characteristics `UpdateTarget`.
-   `~delete`: Deletes specific target, `DeleteTarget`.
-   `~all`: Gets all submitted targets, `GetAllTargets`.

#### Thumbnails

-   `~image/set`: Sets or updates target image thumbnail, `SetTargetImage`.
-   `~image/get`: Retrieves target image thumbnail, `GetTargetImage`.
-   `~image/delete`: Deletes target image thumbnail, `DeleteTargetImage`.
-   `~image/compressed/set`: Sets or updates target image thumbnail with a `CompressedImage`, `SetTargetCompressedImage`.
-   `~image/compressed/get`: Retrieves target image thumbnail as a `CompressedImage`, `GetTargetCompressedImage`.

## Arguments

The following are the run-time ROS launch arguments available:

#### Interop server, credentials, and request parameters

-   `base_url`: AUVSI SUAS interop server url, default: `$INTEROP_HOST` if set, or `http://interop:80`.
-   `username`: AUVSI SUAS interop server username, default: `$INTEROP_USERNAME` if set, or `testadmin`.
-   `password`: AUVSI SUAS interop server password, default: `$INTEROP_PASSWORD` if set, or `testpass`.
-   `timeout`: Timeout for each request in seconds, default: `1.0`.

#### Local object file directory

-   `targets_root`: The parent of all timestamped directories containing object files, default: `~/object_files/`.

    transmit to the server in the telemetry message,
    default: `/mavros/global_position/global`.
-   `compass_topic`: `std_msgs/Float64` feed of the drone's heading in degrees
    to transmit to the server in the telemetry message,
    default: `/mavros/global_position/compass_hdg`.

#### Published topics

-   `flyzones_topic`: `FlyZoneArray` flight boundaries,
    default: `~mission_info/flyzones`.

    default: `~mission_info/waypoints`.
-   `air_drop_topic`: `geometry_msgs/PointStamped` position of the air drop target,
    default: `~mission_info/air_drop_loc`.
-   `emergent_targ_topc`: `geometry_msgs/PointStamped` last known position of the emergent target,
    default: `~mission_info/emergent_targ_loc`.

#### Frame IDs

-   `obstacles_frame`: Frame ID of the obstacles' `MarkerArray` messages,
    default: `odom`.
-   `missions_frame`: Frame ID for the mission messages, default: `odom`.

#### Mission IDs

-   `mission_id`: ID for the first mission to access. Negative numbers
                  will retrieve active mission instead
                  , default: `-1`.

#### Synchronization settings

_Advanced: shouldn't need to be modified._ This tweaks how incoming messages
are synchronized in order to be properly paired. For more information, see
[message filters](http://wiki.ros.org/message_filters/ApproximateTime).

-   `sync_queue_size`: Message synchronization queue size, default: `2`.
-   `max_sync_delay`: Maximum message synchronization delay in seconds,
    default: `1`.

## Known issues

- Obstacles flicker in `rviz`.
